# Firebase Storage Security Rules

Copy and paste these rules into Firebase Console > Storage > Rules

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    // Allow authenticated users to upload to their own posters folder
    match /posters/{userId}/{posterId}/{allPaths=**} {
      // Only allow uploads if the user is authenticated and matches the userId in the path
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      allow delete: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Deny all other access
    match /{allPaths=**} {
      allow read, write: if false;
    }
  }
}
```

## How to Apply:

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to **Storage** > **Rules** tab
4. Replace the existing rules with the rules above
5. Click **Publish**

## What These Rules Do:

- ✅ Authenticated users can read any poster (for Gallery viewing)
- ✅ Users can only upload/delete files in their own `posters/{userId}/` folder
- ✅ Prevents unauthorized access to other users' files
- ✅ Blocks all access to paths outside the `posters/` folder
